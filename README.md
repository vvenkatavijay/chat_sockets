# chat_sockets
This is an app to demonstrate the coolness of sockets. The node module used is socket.io

The app requests for a username and initiates a group chat between all the existing users. The chats are updated 
automatically without a page refresh.
This demonstrates the power of event driven architecture of Node.js. Its so cool!
